VSL and SES measurement:

1) open programms: SMCView (step motor) + Instrument: M266-4 (spectrometer) + C7557-01 (CCD)
2) make the settings of measurements in M266-4 and C7557-01
3) place the SMCView window into the upper left corner of the screen
3) measure background and save it to file where you wanna save measurement
4) measure signal and save it into a certain file
5) place motor on "zero" position
6) open command line in the folder with your data (hold Shift and right mouse click in explorer window on the main panel)

(or get to correct folder by: 
cd \
cd data)

7) run compiled script as e.g.:

C:\Data\> vslsesscript.exe vsl 10000 200 1000 0
C:\Data\> vslsesscript.exe ses 10000 200 1000 250

(1st is the path to your complied script (C:\Data\> vslsesscript.exe)
2nd is what you are gonna measure (vsl/ses), 
3rd is the total length of stripe in microns (as on motor. i.e. twice as big as on sample), 
4th is step in microns (as on motor, i.e. twice as big as on sample) and 
5th is integration time (in CCD software - in ms), 
6th is the "zero" (as appears on motor)

8) leave script measure without moving mouse... if something happens, you can close it in right lower corner of windows (where running software shows up)
