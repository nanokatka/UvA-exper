*About the script*
This script performs automatic measurements for VSL and SES by operating an external slit 
(referred to from here on as the motor) and a CCD trough the applications 'SMCVieW' 
and 'C7557-01' respectively.

*Usage*
First start the applications mentioned above and make sure that they and the spectrograph 
are configured correctly (use instrument panel M266-4 if necessary).
Next, open a commandline in the folder where this file is located (do this by holding 
down shift while right-clicking in the main pane of explorer, or by clicking on start, 
typing cmd in the search box and pressing enter, then navigating to the correct folder 
using the cd command).
Finally, type in 'vslsesscript' (without quotes), followed by the following parameters 
(seperated by spaces):
prefix 		- filename prefix (typically VSL or SES, but can be anything; to include 
		  spaces, enclose it in ")
stripeLength 	- length of the stripe in µm (typically between 4000 and 5000)
stepSize 	- increase of slit width (VSL) or shift of excitation spot (SES) per 
		  iteration in µm (typically 100)
integrationTime - duration of each iteration, i.e. the value used for 'Start 
		  Interval' in the CCD app)
motorRef 	- the motor value that should be treated as zero (smallest slit size)
startAt 	- optional paramter specifyng start position (useful when a previous cycle 
		  was interrupted for some reason, and you want to continue where you left 
		  off)
and press enter to start the script.

*Remarks*
-All parameters, except the prefix, should be integral numbers (decimal values should be 
 supported, but have not been tested).
-You will be asked to select (or create) a location to store the data files generated by 
 the CCD app.
-No need to move the windows to a special location, that will be done automatically.
-A script progress window will appear in the lower right corner of the screen, showing
 the progress of the script and the estimated time remaining before completion.
-Feel free to make any changes to this file, or to the script itself (.au3 file), if you
 think it necessary.
-Do NOT move the mouse while the script is executing, EXCEPT while measuring (i.e. while 
 the 'Measuring Now!' label is blinking in the CCD app).
-Make sure the target folder does not contain any files with the same names as those 
 generated by this script (i.e. prefixNum.txt, where N is a number between 0 and stripeLength)
 or else provide custom names when asked (the script will wait until the Save As dialog is
 no longer visible).
-To stop the execution of the script, right-click the AutoIt icon in the system tray (bottom
 right corner of the screen, click the arrow if the icon is not visible) and select Exit 
 from the menu that pops up.
