VSL and SES measurement:

1) open programms: SMCView (step motor) + Instrument: M266-4 (spectrometer) + C7557-01 (CCD)
2) make the settings of measurements in M266-4 and C7557-01
3) place the SMCView window into the upper left corner of the screen
3) measure background and save it 
4) measure signal and save it into a certain file
5) open command line, run your compiled script as e.g.:

C:\Data\> vslsesscript.exe vsl 10000 100 1000 0
C:\Data\> vslsesscript.exe ses 10000 100 1000 250

(cd \ (goes to root); cd data)


where the 1st is the path to your complied script
2nd is what you are gonna measure, 
3rd is the total length of stripe in microns (as on motor. i.e. twice as big), 
4th is step in microns (as on sample, i.e. usually 100um, which is 200um on motor) and 
5th is integration time, 
6th is the "zero" (as appears on motor)

6) leave him measure without moving mouse
