VSL and SES measurement:

1) open programms: SMCView (step motor) + Instrument: M266-4 (spectrometer) + C7557-01 (CCD)
2) make the settings of measurements in M266-4 and C7557-01
3) place the SMCView window into the upper left corner of the screen
3) measure background and save it 
4) measure signal and save it into a certain file
5) open command line, run your compiled script as e.g.:

C:\Data\Katherina\> 2.exe vsl 5000 100 1000 0
C:\Data\Katherina\> 2.exe ses 5000 100 1000 250

(cd \ (goes to root); cd data; cd Katherina)


where the 1st is the path to your complied script, 2nd is what you are gonna measure, 
3rd is the total length of stripe in microns, 4th is step in microns and 5th is integration time, 5th is the "zero"
